------------


### Description
> In this project I created very simple CRUD app in order to help freshers learn PHP basics better !
> Also, note that it doesn't have any secure route or input validation, etc. since it is a simple CRUD app to learn operations with PDO.

### Main Goal
> Help new PHP developers to understand CRUD operation in plain PHP.

### Note
> It would be better to build websites with PHP frameworks such as Laravel, CakePHP, etc. as they provide a lot of features and help developers to build secure web apps !
